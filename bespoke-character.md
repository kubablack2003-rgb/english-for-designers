In this homework, we've been tasked with creating a unique bespoke character for future purposes of the English course. When asigning the task it was endorsed that a physical letter created from unique material and of unique shape would be more ineteresting and preferable compared to a digital letter simply drawn in Adobe Illustrator or other desktop software.

My first idea was to create one character from a paper cutout that could stand on its own and a second one from its shadow. However, I overestimated my creative patience and while the play of shape, light and shadow seemed interesting at first it quickly turned into an agonizing creative struggle. And so I decided to change my approach to find a more effective way to the process.

Instead of trying to apply all the features at once, I chose only one. A letter that could stand on it's own. From there the design process was pretty much straight forward. I chose a letter that would fit my technicall requirements and material that would be easy to work with yet durable enough. And that is how I came up with the capital letter "Q" made from a paper clip that could stand on its own.
