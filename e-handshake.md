# Hi I'm Jacob
I'm a founder and manager of a small creative agency called [KeySpace](https://www.keyspace.cz/). As far as communication goes, I am fluent in Czech, English and can speak B2 German. Our agency mission is to bring great value to your business through marketing, UX/UI and design solutions. My responsibility is to make sure that the value is on time and works with your company's budget.

If you have a project in mind and you're interested in working with me and my team, feel free to contact me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-cerny-keyspace/).
