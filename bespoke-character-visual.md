This homework was a follow-up on the previouse task ([1.1. Design of a unique Bespoke character](bespoke-character.md)). In class we've been instructed to create a visual that thematically used our unique bespoke character as a initial letter in a short text. This work also aimed to practice our writting skills and so part of the task was to develop the short text as well.

Even before I started writting, I knew that I would write a poem, since a structure of a casual poem isn't too rigid. It can be improvised and doesn't need to be as structured as a scientific text or a news article. For the theme of the poem, I decided to stick to the material that made the character so unique (office paperclip). 

First in my process I needed to find an atractive word to start the text with. The word "quick" felt the best. It was quick and had a certain punch that seemend right to use it as a opener to my casual poem. After that I gave a quick thought to how and where paperclips can be used and how they varie in materials and sizes. These different uses made the filling of my poem cake, letting the reader fatasize a bit about different uses a simple paperclip, before I cut right through delivering the last and very conservative line.

For the visual I decided to work with size and color contrast. I hanged the poem on the side of a abnormally large silver paperclip, signifying the importance of the object to the content of the poem and to foretell the final line of the poem. In the end I achieved a clean and simple look.
